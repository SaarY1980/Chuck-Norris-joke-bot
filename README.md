# Chuck Norris Joke Bot ðŸ¤–

This is a fun command-line Python bot that fetches **random Chuck Norris jokes** using the [Chuck Norris Joke API](https://api.chucknorris.io/).

## How It Works

- Asks the user for a topic
- Searches for jokes using the API
- Picks one at random
- Responds with a random "setup" phrase + the joke
- Repeats until you type `stop`

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `requests` module (install with `pip install requests`)

## Run It

```bash
python ChuckNorris.py

## Author
Made by Saar, inspired by the Chuck Norris API and Python greatness.
